# GLSL: Infinite Voronoi Zoom

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Roman_Murashov/pen/BxOKgb](https://codepen.io/Roman_Murashov/pen/BxOKgb).

First try at (quasi) infinite zoom in GLSL.

Using a standard voronoi pattern over a series of layers and then simply looping through time and space. I need to explore this technique a lot more.

I would appreciate it, if you end up using this code in any sort of production situation, that you cite me in your code and let me know what you've used it for. I love seeing that people actually get use out of the things that I write, and I don't think it's too much to ask that I get a citation for my troubles :)
